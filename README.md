A Battleship game made to help students learn the different aspects of math 


<ins>Instructions :</ins>

You will be asked to choose a difficulty
1 -> coordinate version
2 -> slope version
3 -> inequality version
First, you must place your ships on your own board, ships can be rotated by pressing ‘r’
Then, the computer will place its ships on its board, you will not be able to see the computer’s ships
You will then input a value depending on the difficulty
Guesses on the board will be shown as black X’s and hits will be shown as red X’s
If a ship has sunk on either side, it will indicate at the bottom of the screen
Once a player has sunk all the other player’s ships, they win the game!

<ins>Difficulty 1 - </ins>

This is the coordinates version of the game and is the easiest
Once you place all your ships and the computer places all of its ships, you will be asked to input a coordinate to guess the other player's ship
The program will not allow you to play repeated coordinates

<ins>Difficulty 2 - </ins>

This is the slope version of the game, and is intermediate
You will input an equation for the slope in the form y = mx + b
the program will not allow you to input slopes that are flat lines or undefined slopes
The program will not allow you play repeated slopes
Lines must directly intersect a ship to be considered a hit

<ins>Difficulty 3 - </ins>

This is the inequality version of the game, this is the most advanced version of the game
You will input an equation for the slope but you will also have the option to make it an inequality
Inequalities will show up on the board as pink highlighted squares for a brief moment
The program will tell you how many ships are within the inputted range
The program will not allow you to play repeated inequalities
